## Problem Statement

Students and learners often face difficulty:

- Understanding complex or AI-generated code  
- Grasping coding concepts line by line  
- Preparing effectively for coding interviews or hackathons  

Traditional coding education methods are often too fast, generalized, or lack interactivity, making it hard for students to fully comprehend code logic, debug efficiently, or gain hands-on practice.

## Solution

**KODR** addresses these challenges with a modern, interactive platform:

- **Line-by-Line Code Explanation**: Users paste or write code, and the AI explains every line in real-time.  
- **Flowchart Visualization**: Code logic is displayed as flowcharts for clear understanding.  
- **Multi-Language Support**: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and more.  
- **Adaptive Learning**: Feedback and hints adjust to the user’s level (beginner → advanced).  
- **Interactive Quizzes & Practice**: Generate practice questions, track progress, and improve coding skills.  
- **Hackathon & Interview Preparation**: Focused exercises to prepare users for real-world coding challenges.
